            <li>
              Imagine you&apos;re hosting the most epic party of the year ðŸŽ‰.
              You&apos;ve got the music pumping, the snacks are flowing, and the
              guests are having a blast ðŸ’ƒ. But, just as the night is getting
              wild, people start leaving ðŸ“£. The party space is getting emptier
              and emptier ðŸ¤¯.
            </li>
            <li>
              That&apos;s basically what happens when you have a{" "}
              <b>Stack Underflow</b> ðŸ¤¯. It&apos;s like your party has reached
              minimum capacity, and there&apos;s no one left to join in ðŸŽ‰. In
              programming, this means that your stack (a data structure that
              stores elements in a Last-In-First-Out order) has reached its
              minimum size, and you can&apos;t remove any more elements ðŸ¤¯.

                <li>
                  <b>Too few guests</b> ðŸŽ‰: When you keep removing elements from
                  the stack without checking if it&apos;s empty, you might end
                  up with a stack underflow ðŸ¤¯.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Poor party planning</b> ðŸŽ‰: If you don&apos;t manage your
                  stack&apos;s size correctly, you might end up with a stack
                  underflow ðŸ¤¯.

                <li>
                  <b>Check the guest list</b> ðŸŽ‰: Always check if the stack is
                  empty before removing more elements ðŸ¤¯.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Plan ahead</b> ðŸŽ‰: Manage your stack&apos;s size by
                  regularly adding elements or decreasing its capacity ðŸ¤¯.
