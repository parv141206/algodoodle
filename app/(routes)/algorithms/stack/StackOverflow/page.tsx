              Imagine you&apos;re hosting the most epic party of the year ðŸŽ‰.
              You&apos;ve got the music pumping, the snacks are flowing, and the
              guests are having a blast ðŸ’ƒ. But, just as the night is getting
              wild, the doorbell starts ringing nonstop ðŸ“£. More and more people
              keep showing up, and your party space is getting packed to the
              brim ðŸ¤¯.

              That&apos;s basically what happens when you have a{" "}
              <b>Stack Overflow</b> ðŸ¤¯. It&apos;s like your party has reached
              maximum capacity, and there&apos;s no more room for anyone else to
              join in ðŸŽ‰. In programming, this means that your stack (a data
              structure that stores elements in a Last-In-First-Out order) has
              reached its maximum size, and you can&apos;t add any more elements
              ðŸ¤¯.

                  <b>Too many guests</b> ðŸŽ‰: When you keep pushing elements onto
                  the stack without checking if it&apos;s full, you might end up
                  with a stack overflow ðŸ¤¯.

                <li>
                  <b>Poor party planning</b> ðŸŽ‰: If you don&apos;t manage your
                  stack&apos;s size correctly, you might run out of space and
                  cause a stack overflow ðŸ¤¯.
